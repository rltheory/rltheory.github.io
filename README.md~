# RL theory 2024 (https://rltheory.github.io/2024/)

Help with building the site locally:
1. Clone this directory locally: `git clone https://github.com/rltheory/2024`
2. Install Jekyll by following the instructions given here (https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
3. Navitate to the repository folder and open a terminal inside it
4. Possibly you'll have to run `bundle install`
5. Finally, run `bash startlocalservice`.

Then the website will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:4000/2024/` in the browser (or some link like that; the terminal will specify the link). 

If everything looks good, you may push the changes to Github to update the website globally.
